# Campaign-Analysis-using-A-B-Testing-


Campaign analysis project is about choosing the best campaign among the two campaigns which was conducted by a company. The company provided two datasets containing detailed information of each campaigns.The datasets includes details like number of clicks, impressions, purchases, reaches,views etc.,
To find out the best out of two, I have conducted hypothesis testing and A/B testing where i have successfully achieved the accurate results from the analysis.
I utilized various python libraries including Numpy, Pandas for searching and cleaning the datasets, SciPy for statistical analysis and Matplotlib, Seaborn for the visualization. 
Data cleaning involved renaming the columns, handling the missing values, normalizing numerical features.
Data manipulation involved merging the data and adding two new columns: Click Through Rate and Conversion Rate which is very necessary for the analysis.
Analysing these CTR and CR values releaved the better performace campaign among the two.These metrics provided critical insights, revealing the better-performing campaign based on audience engagement, purchases and conversion efficiency.
